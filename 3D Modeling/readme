This is a collection of my 3D modeling work, most of it was created in Solidworks, but I have experience with Onshape, Inventor and Fusion360 as well.
Many of these projects were created as a team (FRC Team 2122: Team Tators). If you want to see the full robot CAD, email me at connorparrott123@gmail.com.
Most onseasons were focused on fast design and robot production. Offseasons were times of learning/teaching often both.
