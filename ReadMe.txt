This list is by no means exhaustive, but it shows a number of the assignments I have completed and gives a solid baseline of the things I have learned. I know Java, C/C++ and Python though I am a quick learner and have the skills to learn new languages should the need arise. I have experience programming in various IDEs and on the command line. I have experience with make files, VI/VIM, and am capable of programming and implementing data structures.



Feel free to ask questions if the code is unclear or you have further questions about my experience! (Email: connorparrott123@gmail.com).
