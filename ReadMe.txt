This list is by no means exhaustive, but it shows a number of the assignments I have completed and gives a solid baseline of the things I have learned.
Feel free to ask questions if the code is unclear or you have further questions about my experience. (Email: connorparrott123@gmail.com). I think my 
commenting on a few of these documents is lacking, but I have a few good examples that demonstrate what I can do if others will be reading/editing my code.
