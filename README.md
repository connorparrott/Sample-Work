# Sample-Work
    I've completed courses in C/C++, Java, Python and Javascript. I have completed an internship working as a fullstack web developer at Miltech. I currently work with the Space Science Engineering Lab (SSEL) and am working on the REAL Cubesat. The expected launch date is april 2024. Much of the sample work shown in this repository are class assignments as much of my work in internships is proprietary. On my own time, I am learning data science and Machine Learning to further develop my skills.
