# Sample-Work
    I've completed courses in C/C++, Java, Python and Javascript. I have completed an internship working as a fullstack web developer at Miltech. I currently work with the Space Science Engineering Lab (SSEL) and am working on the REAL Cubesat. The expected launch date is april 2024. On my own time, I am learning data science and Machine Learning to further develop my skills.
