# Sample-Work
I have completed an internship working as a fullstack web developer at Miltech. I currently work with the Space Science Engineering Lab (SSEL) as their Software Lead. I work on a variety of missions including:
* MUSE (BUBO)
* REAL
* IMPRESS
* SFXTI (EISSFLAIX)

More information about these missions can be found here: https://ssel.montana.edu/missions.html

Much of the sample work shown in this repository are class assignments as much of my work in internships is proprietary. On my own time, I am learning data science and Embedded Programming to further develop my skills.
